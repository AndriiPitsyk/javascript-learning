Exercise 1:
Create a Person class with the following:
- A constructor that takes name and age.
- A method introduce() that logs: "Hi, my name is [name] and I am [age] years old."

Exercise 2:
Modify the Person class to include a method celebrateBirthday() that increases the person's age by 1 and logs:
"Happy Birthday! You are now [age] years old."

Exercise 3:
Create a Student class that inherits from Person. It should:
- Have an additional property grade.
- Override introduce() to include: "I am in grade [grade]."

Exercise 4:
Create a class hierarchy where a base class represents a general Vehicle, and a subclass represents a specific type of vehicle,
such as a Car. The subclass should inherit from the base class and use super to pass some values to the parent constructor.

1. Create a Vehicle class with properties: brand (the brand of the vehicle) & speed (initially set to 0). Methods:
accelerate(amount): Increases the speed by the given amount.
brake(amount): Decreases the speed, but it cannot go below 0.
showInfo(): Logs the current brand and speed of the vehicle.

2. Create a Car class that extends Vehicle with additional properties: fuelType (e.g., "Petrol", "Diesel", "Electric").
Methods: signal(): prints "Beep beep! This is a <brand> car." and implement showInfo() to also display the fuel type.

Ensure proper class inheritance:
The Car class should use super to pass brand to the Vehicle class. All methods should work correctly for both classes.
