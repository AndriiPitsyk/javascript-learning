Exercise 1:
Write a for loop that calculates the factorial of 5 (5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1).

Exercise 2:
Modify the loop below to stop when a number greater than 50 is found. Use break here.

const numbers = [10, 20, 30, 60, 40, 50];
for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    // Your code here
}

Exercise 3:
Given an array of numbers, write a loop that skips all negative numbers and prints only positive numbers. Use continue here.
const numbers = [10, -5, 20, -8, 30, -2];

for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    // Your code here
}

Exercise 4:
- Write a for loop that prints Fibonacci numbers up to 10.

Exercise 5:
Rewrite the code changing the for loop to while without altering its behavior (the output should stay same).
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  console.log( `number ${i}!` );
}

Exercise 6:
1. Write a while loop that prints numbers from 10 to 1.

2. Write a while loop that calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to 5.
let num = 1;
let sum = 0;

while (num <= 5) {
     // Your code here
}

Exercise 7:
Write a do...while loop that prints only even numbers from 2 to 20.

Exercise 8:
Write a do...while loop that finds the largest number in an array.

const numbers = [3, 7, 2, 9, 5, 11, 4];
let i = 0;
let max = numbers[0];
// Your code here
console.log("Largest number:", max);

Exercise 9:
Write a for...of loop that sums all the numbers in the array:

const numbers = [5, 10, 15, 20];
let sum = 0;
// Your code here
console.log("Sum:", sum);

Exercise: 10
Write a for...of loop that finds the longest word in an array.
const words = ["apple", "banana", "strawberry", "kiwi"];
let longest = "";
// Your code here
console.log("Longest word:", longest);

Exercise: 11
1. Write a for...in loop that prints all the keys of an object
const person = { name: "Alice", age: 25, city: "New York" };
// Your code here

2. Write a for...in loop that prints all the values of an object.
const car = { brand: "Tesla", model: "Model 3", year: 2023 };
   // Your code here

3. Write a for...in loop that prints both keys and values of an object.
const book = { title: "Harry Potter", author: "J.K. Rowling", year: 1997 };
// Your code here

Exercise 12:
Write a for...of loop that iterates over an array of objects, printing each property of the objects using for...in.
 const students = [
     { name: "John", age: 20, grade: "A" },
     { name: "Emma", age: 22, grade: "B" },
     { name: "Michael", age: 21, grade: "A+" }
 ];
 // Your code here
