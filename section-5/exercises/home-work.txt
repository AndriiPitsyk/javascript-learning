const username = "";
if (username) {
  console.log("User exists");
} else {
  console.log("No user found");
}

Exercise 6:
Rewrite the following if-else statement using a ternary operator:

const temp = 30;
if (temp > 25) {

}

Exercise 7:
What will be the result of the code bellow? Think without code execution:

if(!isAdult) {
    console.log('Truthy')
} else {
    console.log('Falsy')
}

const points = 0;
console.log(points || 100 );

2. What will be the result of the code bellow? Think without code execution:
const username = "";
console.log(username && "Guest");

3.What will be the result of the code bellow? Think without code execution:
const userCountry = null;

Exercise 9:
What will be the result of the code bellow? Think without code execution:

function getUserData(userData) {
    return {
        name: userData.name || 'Default value',
        year: userData.year || 2005,
    }
}

console.log(getUserData({name: 'Test user'}));
console.log(getUserData({year: 2005}));
console.log(getUserData({}));

Exercise 10:
Use all three logical assignment operators (||=, &&=, ??=) in one function:

function updateUser(user) {
  // Your code here
}

const user1 = { name: "", age: null, premium: true };
const user2 = { name: "Alice", age: 25, premium: false };

updateUser(user1);
updateUser(user2);

console.log(user1);
/* Expected Output:
{ name: "Guest", age: 18, premium: true }
*/

console.log(user2);
/* Expected Output:
{ name: "Alice", age: 25, premium: false }
*/
